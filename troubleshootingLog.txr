troubleshooting log:
1. not getting a correct request with command
      ./nvycat courses.cs.usna.edu 80 /~bilzor/saturn.txt
2. the path variable is reflecting the port, not the path
3. how do I get what is being written to the pipe to save to a variable?
    (aka I want the request that is being sent to the pipe to save to the
      variable request so that I can plug that into my thing )
